# PianoApp

Music app / piano
- plays keys (noise) 
- mild animation 
- record information / save what you made
- responds to touch
- on the side have a slider to slide keys up and down the side to almost have a full piano

So here's what we need
1. Piano keyboard and scroll
- piano keys make sounds
- slider animation
(this is done by multiple stacked views and buttons)
- optional: tag each key with its respective letter

2. Homepage
- buttons
- basic music animation 
3. Save feature
- record
- view records
- audio recording / play back
